3- a search facility is available (simple reverse index on Title and Content),  
4- RSS/atom facility is available,  
5- multi-language support (for the time being Go only, but with a specific classification),  
6- tags, categories supported (draft doc. is not processed),  
7- rendering based on layouts/templates, 
8- Source Code syntax highlighted thanks to the tool by Andre Simon, see here: http://www.andre-simon.de/ 
9- Markdown input based (using the Go "blackfriday" package by Russ Ross),   
10- Easy to evolve to a more sophisticated web/docs generator,   
11- A massive thanks to Alexander Demin, who is the original designer of this generator!
